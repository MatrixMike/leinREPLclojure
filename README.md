lein Clojure REPL examples

A collection of snippets that run in a REPL where REPL could be from direct clojure or lein repl.

The aim is to convert the snippets into compileable code that produces .jar files ( e.g. from lein uberjar )
and by converting I aim to learn about Clojure and more about Java and Interop etc.
